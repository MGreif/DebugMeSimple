# DebugMeSimple

This is a simple project i created to get hands-on experience with Anti-Debugging measures.
I will try to update this in an ongoing process as i experiment with new Anti-Debugging tricks.

# Solution

I added simple bypassing techniques into the source-code, but using scylla and passing exceptions to the app should bypass the current Anti-Debug features lol

# ToDo

I want to learn about and add:
- NtSetInformationThread (ThreadHideFromDebugger)
- Enumerating window names for common debugger titles
- OutputDebugString
- Self debugging
